This is a simple java swing app.
Main purpose of this project is to compare two databases(oracle for now) without need for installing sql developer(for oracle).
Source db means current and up to date database and target database means database needs to be updated compared to source database.
For now,
only compares tables,columns,views,constraints.No data is compared.
